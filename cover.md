Dear Editors:
  
We are submitting our manuscript, “Cohort-based approach to understanding the roles of generation and serial intervals in shaping epidemiological dynamics”, for consideration for publication in PNAS. This material has not previously been published elsewhere.

The generation interval is defined as the time between when an individual (infector) is infected and when that individual infects another individual (infectee).
The serial interval is defined as the time between when the infector develops symptom and when the infectee develops symptom.
Even though these intervals were clearly and distinctly defined over a decade ago, there is a lack of a theoretical framework that describes the differences between the two intervals.
Some studies have further concluded that generation and serial intervals can give different estimates of the reproduction number from the exponential growth rate while relying on imprecise definitions of serial intervals.
Nonetheless, disease modelers continue to rely on both generation and serial intervals interchangeably to estimate the reproduction number and make inferences about the epidemic dynamics.
The need for a better conceptual and theoretical framework for understanding their differences is becoming clearer as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

This article proposes what we believe is both a significant conceptual and practical advance in understanding the role of generation and serial intervals in shaping epidemiological dynamics.
We first present a general framework for characterizing epidemiological delay distributions and use it to study how realized serial interval changes over the course of an epidemic.
We show that the ``forward-looking'' serial interval (from the perspective of infectors who became symptomatic at the same time), which provides the correct link between the exponential rate and the reproduction number, is different from the intrinsic serial interval, which corresponds to the definition of serial intervals previous studies have relied on.
We analyze serial interval data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China to demonstrate how neglecting changes in the serial-interval distribution biases the estimates of the reproduction number and provide a heuristic method for addressing the bias.

The manuscript and its findings should be of interest to a broad range of readers. All code is available as open-source for use, re-use, and adaptation by the community. We request an expedited review. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration of our submission.

Sincerely,

Sang Woo Park
