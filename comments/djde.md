This is very nice work. For the moment, I have restrained myself from taking note of typos and phrasing that could be improved. I think some careful thought needs to be given to venue.  With a lot of tightening, and a bit more sensitivity to the needs of a broad readership, this seems like something that could be sent to PNAS. It is important because so many people just assume the serial interval is a good estimate of the generation interval and don't worry about it further (and that needs to be articulated clearly, even in the abstract).  I also don't think that framing this as resolving a paradox is the best approach. I don't think most people think there is a paradox -- they just assume it is OK to approximate GIs with SIs and get on with it.  You are addressing the pitfalls of doing that and how to get around them.

line 85.  \pi is a weird symbol to use for a time.  I assume you've picked to represent "primary".

line 89.  If \pi is for primary, perhaps \sigma for secondary.  Using \pi for primary and \delta for secondary isn't ideal, especially since you really want \delta to be available to be used as the Dirac delta function when you need to talk about convolutions.

line 95.  Perhaps S(\sigma) rather than D(\delta) for the secondary cohorts?  I realize that's not great when S should refer to the susceptible population.  Maybe \Sigma(\sigma) and \Pi(\pi)   :)   You could use script P and S to get around this.

line 97-98.  It might be good to get across that the dependence on P(\delta-\tau) is relative to D(\delta).  Perhaps discuss why this formula makes sense in the special case that f is a fixed delay?  (Integrating implies P(\delta-T)=D(\delta) for all \delta, if T is the fixed delay, and this makes total sense.)

line 107.  \sigma for serial would be less confusing than \sigma for generation.  Perhaps use s for serial and g for generation (and \mathcal S and G for the distributions)?  Hopefully you're using macros for all these symbols...

line 117.  Here you introduce the term "backward incubation period", without definition, as if this should mean something clear to the reader. I don't like this term, though I do understand why you're using it.  In my mind, there is no meaning to "forward" or "backward" when you talk about an individuals' incubation period.  Whether you happen to measure it from the moment of infection (forward) or from the moment of symptom onset (backward) it is the same.  You are using the terms "forward" and "backward" to capture signs in front of x_0 and x_1 in eq (3).  These signs are not intrinsic to x_0 and x_1 themselves. Referring to x_0 and x_1 as backward and forward seem to me to just add to confusion.  If you feel strongly that you want to stick to this terminology then I think it is extremely important to carefully introduce it and explain it.  After all, the whole point of this is to learn via clarifying concepts.  You could say that you are going to refer to backwards/forwards periods of whatever to indicate whether the period is measured backward/forward in time, but make crystal clear that the length of the period is the same in either case.  Note that in your terminology the backward serial interval distribution is not the distribution of backward serial intervals (which one might expect), it is the distribution of serial intervals measured backwards for a given time.

line 128.  To make your point genuinely clear, I think you need to display the expression in line 120 and line 128 and refer to them both so there is no doubt what you are claiming is "clearly demonstrated".  In general, rather than stating that something is clear, explain it.

line 132.  What do you mean by "the total number of serial intervals" ?? Do you mean "the expected number of individuals who start their serial interval between \pi and \delta"?

eq (4).  use {\rm c} rather than $c$ as the subscript on R_c so the subscript doesn't look like a variable.  T for "total number" is not great.  \Sigma could potentially work here.

After eq (5), you should explain what the constant of proportionality is. I guess it is the expected number of individuals who first show symptoms after time \pi.

A bit of handholding for understanding the limits of integration in (5) and (6) would also be helpful to most readers.

Again, state the meaning of the constant of proportionality in eq (6).

line 146.  What theory?  What exactly are you going to validate?
